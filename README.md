# Permutation Equivariant Set Autoencoding with Conditional Variational Flow Matching

Final project for CS 598, Deep Generative Models. The generation of set-structured data requires specialized generative models that are permutation equivariant with respect to their inputs. Current existing models that meet this criterion predominantly perform generation of an entire set in a single step. We present a permutation equivariant set autoencoder that decodes either an entire set or a single batch of elements at a time, thereby enabling sequential and multi-step generation. The decoder is a modified conditional variational flow matching model, which can account for local dependencies within the set while maintaining permutation equivariance. We demonstrate the efficacy of our model on the SetMNIST and ShapeNet datasets, consisting of 2D and 3D point clouds, respectively. Our results indicate enhanced generative capabilities over traditional conditional flow matching and diffusion-based approaches for point cloud generation.
